# Node Backend + (React + Vite)  Frontend

This repo is an example Backend Express/Node with connected  React + Vite Frontend Project 


## The stack includes:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) for frontend
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling
- [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/) for database access
- [NextAuth](https://next-auth.js.org/) for authentication
- [Cloudflare D1](https://www.cloudflare.com/developer-platform/d1/) for serverless databases
- [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) for hosting
- [ShadcnUI](https://shadcn.com/) as the component library

## Getting Started

Run the app locally with

    $ npm run dev

This will start the local token server and run the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to see the application in the browser.

The page will reload if you make changes to the source code in `src/`.
You will also see any linting errors in the console. Start the token server locally with

    $ npm run start


## The Beauty of This Stack (WIP)

- Fully scalable and composable
- Environment variables needed 
- Powerful tools like Mango DB for database management and migrations
- Cost-effective scaling (e.g., $5/month for multiple high-traffic projects)

Just change your Cloudflare account ID in the project settings, and you're good to go!
